Datasets
=======
    They are too big thus cannot be stored on a public Github repo.
    Download themit manually:

	> cd exp-scripts/datasets; ./download-data.sh; cd ../..
	The above two datasets are essentially a numpy array with the shape = (number of time stamps, number of time series) stored in a row major format.

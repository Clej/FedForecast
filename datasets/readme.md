Datasets
=======
    They are too big thus cannot be stored on a public Github repo.
    Download themit manually:

	> cd datasets; ./download-datasets.sh; cd ../..
	The two datasets are essentially numpy arrays with the shape = (number of time stamps, number of time series) stored in a row major format.
